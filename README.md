This repository saves the light curve data for our paper (TITLE & LINK HERE). The parameters (progenitor mass, CSM profile, explosion energy) adopted are in the filename.
Columns are time from energy injection [days], luminosity [erg/s], effective temperature [K]. The plots for all the bolometric light curves are accessible in SNEC_plots.pdf

The light curve starts at 3 days before the time of shock breakout (recorded in SNEC), and continues with timestep of 0.02 days until 1000, 700 and 500 days from energy injection for the 1e48 erg, 3e48 erg, 1e49 erg respectively.
