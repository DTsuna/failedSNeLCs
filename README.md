This repository saves the light curves for our paper (TITLE & LINK HERE). The parameters (progenitor mass, CSM profile, explosion energy) adopted are in the filename.
Columns are time from energy injection [days], luminosity [erg/s], effective temperature [K]. The light curve is started at 3 days before the time of shock breakout (recorded in SNEC).
