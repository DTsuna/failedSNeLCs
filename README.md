This repository saves the light curve data for our paper "Transients by Black Hole Formation from Red Supergiants: Impact of Dense Circumstellar Matter" (arXiv:2410.XXXXX). 

The parameters (progenitor mass, CSM profile, explosion energy) adopted are in the filename. Names with ``Mdot" are for the superwind profiles with the number being the mass-loss rate, and those with ``vrat" are for the dense chromosphere model by [Fuller & Tsuna (2024)][https://doi.org/10.33232/001c.120130].
Columns are time from energy injection [days], luminosity [erg/s], effective temperature [K]. The plots for all the bolometric light curves are accessible in SNEC_plots.pdf

The light curve starts at 3 days before the time of shock breakout (recorded in SNEC), and continues with timestep of 0.02 days until 1000, 700 and 500 days from energy injection for the 1e48 erg, 3e48 erg, 1e49 erg respectively.
